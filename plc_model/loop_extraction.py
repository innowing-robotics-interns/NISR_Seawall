    """
    For each slice, one 3D centre per enclosed region and the rms distance to the
    normals of the points that region answers for.

    The centre is a positive-field cell nearest the centroid of the area the
    loop's normals enclose, solved for as a Poisson problem. Unlike the centroid
    itself, that cell cannot fall outside a concave region. The point closest to
    all the normal lines, which is what this used to report, is pulled
    off a kinked or folded loop and can land outside it. Which is also why the
    grouping never consults the fitted centre -- an arc of an ellipse fits a
    centre far from the real one, so agreeing centres cannot decide that two arcs
    are one loop.

    A group whose points are two loops merged together still encloses two areas,
    and gets one centre each, which is how two rings too close to separate by
    their points alone stay two. A group that encloses nothing, an open arc being
    the usual case, gets the normal-line fit instead.

    Every loop is answered for by its own points alone. The parting comes first:
    the positive part of the solved field a point sits in is the loop it belongs
    to, read off an area rather than chosen among centres. Each part is then solved
    again from its own points and normals, and every smaller positive part found by
    that solve is kept and checked in turn. What a centre reports is therefore the
    centre of a final positive component, not of a group holding several.

    The rms is the quality tell. Zero means the normals do agree on one spot, as
    they do on a circular or spherical loop. Large means they do not: the loop is
    concave, or elliptical enough that its normals never meet, and no single
    point is the centre of it.

    One panel per slice, holding the implicit field of every loop in it.

    The field is what poisson_field solves for, divided by its own peak: 1 over
    the area a loop encloses and negative outside it, because the solve is asked
    for zero mean. It is smooth rather than compact, so the loop does not sit at
    zero -- measured on the cuboid hand, the points lie where the field has
    fallen to 0.14-0.37 of its peak and the zero itself crosses about 0.1, a
    tenth of the slice, outside them. The level that runs along the loop is
    therefore the region threshold, half the peak, which is why the centres are
    taken at that level and land inside. So the colour map shows the same thing
    the centres are read off: a loop whose points leave a stretch unwalled fills
    no area at all, and its centre falls back to the normal-line fit.

    Each field carries its own peak, so each is shown at its own scale. A loop
    whose normals disagree solves to values thousands of times larger than a
    clean one, and on one shared scale the clean ones would be flat white.

    Each field is drawn on the grid it was solved on, at that grid's own place
    and cell size, so a panel is a picture of the field the centres came from
